# My Credo

I believe I am created in the image of God.  
**Because I believe this, I must recognize, honour, and respect the divine in my fellow human beings.**

I believe I am a unique person.  
**Because of my uniqueness, I must make peace with myself, accept myself, and become friends with the image in the mirror.**

I believe that being creatively engaged is the highest form of human existence.  
**To be creatively engaged means that every day I must create something that did not exist before, for I know that I, who am myself a creation, must do something to build upon and extend that creation.**

I believe I have free will with the power to make choices and decisions.  
**These choices and decisions I must take responsibly, and I myself will stand surety for their consequences.**

I believe that, within the limits of my humanity, I can change my circumstances.  
**I must change those circumstances that I can improve, and cheerfully accept those that I cannot change.**

If I truly believe these things, and as a free person accept my divine commission and my responsibilities,  
**then I can step into the future with faith and be a participant — not a spectator — in the wondrous experience called LIFE.**

It is my striving that, at the end of my life, I may humbly say:  
> “I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, and I have kept the faith.”  
> — 2 Timothy 4:7

**My house is built on rock. The storm will pass.**
