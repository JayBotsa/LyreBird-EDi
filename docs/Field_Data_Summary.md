# Field Data Summary – LyreBird-EDi / FarmAuto Deployment

**Current as of December 17, 2025**  
**System:** LyreBird Communications + FarmAuto Units 
**Communication:** LyreBird Chirp Technologies / mesh – no cloud dependency, offline-first, push-from-source ("shout" mechanism)  
**Developed & Deployed:** South Africa, consulting via General Solutions Consultants with R&B Projects.

## Key Deployment Statistics

- **Active Field Units:** 80+  
  - Deployed and operational across multiple farms (dams, center pivots, silos, fuel/LP tanks, pumps, mobile refuelers)  
  - Mix of Dam Units, Center Pivot Units, Silo Monitors, and custom nodes

- **Uptime & Reliability:**  
  - Field-tested continuously for over 5 years (since ~2020)  
  - 100% reliable operation in online & offline/no-internet conditions  
  - Proven long-range: live demo with unit km's away – real-time toggle and data display via Node-RED UI
  - Chirp Tube node control for Technitians `@EDi_t_e`  

- **Core Features Proven in Field:**  
  - Real-time monitoring: water levels (radar/ultrasonic), analog/digital inputs, system health, environmental data  
  - Automation: Storm Mode, wind protection, pump control, alerts/notifications  
  - Data Integrity: 32-character packets, 12-bit analog range validation, single-bit guiding mechanism  
  - Sensors Integrated: rain gauges, soil moisture, CO2 (greenhouse/silo), GPS tracking, lightning detection, and expanding list (Now/Next/Future categories)

- **Impact Highlights:**  
  - Prevents waste: early burst pipe/flood detection, precise irrigation  
  - Saves time/labor: remote monitoring & control replaces manual checks  
  - Increases yield/security: protects crops, fuel, grain stocks  
  - Scalable: units chain/communicate peer-to-peer, mesh extends coverage

## Milestones from Development & Testing

- Early prototypes → full field rollout (80+ units)  
- Live demos: onsite + remote units toggled in real-time (2025)  
- Protocol evolution: Layer 1 validation, noise filtering, CPU cube integration, forking levels (Root → Global)  
- UI: Node-RED dashboards with gauges, Live/View/Interactive modes

This is a living system – built by farmers, for farmers. Earth first, Mars next.  
No app, no cloud, voice-first ready. Data stays with the owner.
