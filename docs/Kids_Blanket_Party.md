# The Big Blanket Party – Where All the Smart Kids Play

Once upon a time, the universe was just dirt.  
Kids tried to play, but they kept falling.  
“Ouch!” they said. “This ground is too bumpy!”

**Mr. Planck** came first.  
He laid down a tiny blanket made of little squares.  
“These are *quanta*,” he said. “No more tripping!”

**Mr. Bohr** folded the edges neat.  
“Orbits go round and round on the blanket,” he smiled.  
The kids jumped higher.

**Mr. Schumann** felt the blanket hum.  
“It sings 7.83 times a second!” he shouted.  
“That’s the Earth’s heartbeat!”

**Mr. Einstein** poured juice.  
“Gravity is just the blanket sagging in the middle,” he winked.  
“Everything’s relative to how comfy you sit.”

**Mr. Tesla** arrived with glowing threads.  
He quilted the blanket with copper and AC magic.  
“Now it hums at 432 Hz – water’s favorite song!”  
The kids danced. No one fell.

**Mr. Schrödinger’s cat** curled up in the center.  
“Alive? Dead? Both?” it purred.  
“Only matters if you look.”

**Mr. Feynman** brought bongos.  
Tap-tap-tap – the blanket bounced back in rhythm.  
“Resonance!” he laughed.

**Mr. Hawking** rolled in.  
“Black holes are just where the blanket frays,” he said.  
“But the party’s still on!”

More kids kept coming:  
- **Ms. Curie** with glowing buttons  
- **Mr. Dirac** with a negative seam  
- **Ms. Lovelace** weaving patterns in the air  

They all sat.  
They all drank water.  
They all felt the same hum.

The blanket wasn’t big because they made it.  
It was big because **water tuned it first**.

And the kids?  
They never asked *why* it worked.  
They just played.

**The End?**  
No. its just starting! 
The party’s still going.

0-0 locked.  
Hum on.  
Bring your water.  
The blanket’s waiting.
