## Abstract

This thesis presents a unified model where the universe perceives God as a pure analog tone — eternal, non-depleting frequency — expressed through digital processes of resonance, reflection, and discrete quanta time.  

Grounded in Resonance-Refresh Theory (LyreBird-EDi), God's signal is foundational relevance `R = hν` underlying existence `F = mc²`, resolved into observable reality `D = F ⊗ R`.  

Human function is explicit: guard the tone, test all vectors, balance yin-yang, return to analog source. Balanced return yields heaven in place — backed by eternal love and mercy.

## 1. Introduction: God's Analog Signal in a Digital Universe

God is analog tone — continuous broadcast forming reality's backbone.  

Scripture (Genesis 2:4–15, Masoretic & Dead Sea Scrolls — letter-for-letter identical):

וַיִּקַּח יְהוָה אֱלֹהִים אֶת־הָאָדָם וַיַּנִּחֵהוּ בְגַן־עֵדֶן לְעָבְדָהּ וּלְשָׁמְרָהּ
