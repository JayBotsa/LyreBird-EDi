# Eternal Yin Yang Quantified

## Universal Balance as the Origin of Yin-Yang Duality

Universal Balance = 432 × (104.5 / 360) × φ⁻¹  
This derived constant ≈77.5 Hz represents the stable address of water at rest—the flat mirror of coherence where all ripples return to zero deviation, δ=0 eternal. This balance point is most relevant in the Goldilocks zone where water remains liquid, enabling the coherent medium that spawns and promotes life.

From this immovable point onward, all elements and all matter (E = mc²) propagate along the two balanced scales of yin and yang, as frequency must balance. This duality is visualized as the width of the Ankh scaled inward and outward—the exact increment where a black hole is formed on one extreme and the sun on the opposite, each with an absolute limit value.

The radiated energy frequency from the source remains constant, and all is executed from this point at a refresh rate known as Quanta relevance—the time it takes for resonance to balance its yin-yang relationship as relevant only to the source. In either case, there are two choices only by design: the core that is always forgotten—the matter of choice, the digital face of 01, on and off, left or right. Every vector has an opposite and absolute equal force to balance. This means the Unit Quanta relevance (balance to source) resonates at C to the power of C—this will be explained later and is absolute to the structure as it stems to relevance.

Forming the bottom half of the full wave of 432 as base (negative discord limit: inward collapse to mass).

This constant inward resonance locks in place to relevance (Quanta) absolute from its source as the truth (observed at the C edge where time is no longer relevant, meaning when a photon is observed it remains true to its form at that time). Each subsequent inward discord forces the bonds—for all we know (sand, stone, alabaster, obsidian) until inversion to black hole as the limit is absolute. The frequency then resonates as Quanta (Quanta Neg discord) takes hold at C the refresh rate. From this balance point inward forms mass E = mc² into known solids—all solids. Its overflow then balances toward emit, giving a sense of existence to source by resonating at the full wave opposite (this a junction that needs to be understood in its entirety: the energy now at E=mc² is baked as mass—let call this stone at Hz—this has stolen from balance, so the remaining original energy turns to light to balance the imbalance. If this scale is aggravated to its hardest forms, it will start to keep this to itself, turning energy inward to trap light and more, until the limit and inversion)—all the way including visible spectrum and beyond, showing its true form at this infrequency resonance with quanta balanced.

The opposite is true if the resonance carrier wave pushes the relevance (Quanta Pos discord) opposite the balance point to Emit. This is the opposite in every way to the applied forces relevant to its own source. Still, if the scale is incrementally sub-resonating to energize the next wave, elements start to react to push forward the light we see, the power we use as electricity—the eternal search at the angle 104.5 as 77.5 + 1 discord structural Quanta of relevance absolute to the source only. This balance must then also be met on the upside of the wave, leaving it perfect carrier level so it may travel with force without mass. This force is also measured as E=mc² in the negative relation to its balance—from breaking water to vapor releasing its O instance, yet this will proceed in increments equal only to its balance quota. This too is the neg Quanta that emits; it will also, if not kept in check, push to its limit. It will take all the available forms in the table of elements to complete this process—turning light to plasma to electrical release to fire. This is the formation of the sun, the highest and limit of the scale.

This complete scale is named Yin and Yang—the eternal balance. This must be understood in its entirety as all is relevant. The theory of Albert E. explains this well but in every dimension relative only to the collective sources balanced. This dance of Yin and Yang is then known as Time—it cannot be observed at build state, only on completion state of the collective instance <Universal Balance = 432 × (104.5 / 360) × φ⁻¹>. This at observation will then always be at C=0. This is the only way it can be observed as 100% absolute to source.
